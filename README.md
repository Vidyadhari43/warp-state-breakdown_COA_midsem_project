# Warp-state-breakdown
This is my midsem project done in my 3rd year computer science undergraduate course as part of computer organisation and architecture (COA) course.<br>

The objective of this project is to modify GPGPU-source code to introduce the counters which capture the state of the warp (state of the warp indicates Waiting, issued, Xalu, Xmem, other). Then we need to plot the warps state breakdown for each kernel in the applications/benchmarks.
